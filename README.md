BandwidthMonitor
================

Description
-----------
This project was created after I began suffering from poor network latency and download speeds from my supposedly 'awesome' [Sky Fibre Broadband](http://www.sky.com/shop/broadband-talk/fibre-optic/).

The project uses:
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Express
* Jade
* Socket.io

Prerequisites
-------------
The app will run on any OSX / Linux machine (probably also Windows, but this hasn't been confirmed). 
* Node.js (>0.8.x)
* MongoDB running locally

Installation
------------
1. Checkout & extract the latest tag
2. Open up a command line in the folder you've extracted the project into
3. Install using: `npm install`
4. Run the server using: `node app.js` 
5. Open a browser at `http://localhost:3000` and watch the graphs.
